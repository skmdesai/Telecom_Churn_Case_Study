## General Information
- Build ML models to predict whether high value customer will churn or not,in near future.
- Identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn.
- Even though overall accuracy will be your primary evaluation metric, you should also mention other metrics like precision, recall, etc. 
for the different models that can be used for evaluation purposes based on different business objectives.
- Recommend strategies to manage customer churn based on observations
